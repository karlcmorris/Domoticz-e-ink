Very much work in progress. 
Raspberry Pi Zero connected to a waveshare 7.5 inch:
https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT

Pulls data directly from Domoticz and Tasmota via JSON API's

Main.py is where it all happens. Cali.py is supposed to reset the e-ink but I dont think its needed

Main.py runs via crontab every 5 mins. The e-ink screen takes around 5 seconds to refresh.

The image of my daughter is there beacuse she didnt think it was possible - Paige, github fame awaits:)
